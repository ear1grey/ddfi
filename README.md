DDFI - Drag and Drop File Inspector
==========

Try it: http://ear1grey.github.io/ddfi/


Introduction
---
A drag and drop file inspector.

Drag a file to the browser and information about the file is displayed.  Different files can be displayed in different ways (so far image and video files are handled.)


Build it
---
1. Check out the source.
2. `npm init` to prepare the build dependencies.
3. `grunt` to build.


Improve it
---
Pull requests are more welcome!


Future Work Ideas
---
Make filetypes pluggable and help-able by third-party modules.
Make helper modules discoverable on the fly, somehow.
